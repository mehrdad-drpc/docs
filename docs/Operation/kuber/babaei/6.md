# Install & Update Backup

## Backup Candidates

- Resource Configuration
- ETCD Cluster
- Persist Volumes
  - [Velero] is a Backup and migrate Kubernetes resources and persistent volumes

## Installation, Configuration and Validation

### Objectives

- Design a Kubernetes Cluster
- Choosing Kubernetes Infrastructure
- H.A. Kubernetes Cluster
- Deploy a Kubernetes Cluster
- Cluster E2E Test

### Purpose use of Kubernetes Cluster

- Education
  - MiniKube
  - Single-node cluster with Kubeadm/GCP/AWD
- Development & Testing
  - Multi-node cluster with a **Single Master** and **Multiple Workers**
  - Setup using kubeadm tool or quick provision on GCP/AWS/AKS

- Hosting Production Application
  - **Hight Available** multi-node cluster with **Multi Master Node**
  - Using *kubeadm/KOps* on-perm or GCP/AWS or other supported platform
  - Considering for large cluster
    - up to 5k nodes
    - up to 150k PODs in the cluster
    - up to 300k total containers
    - up to 100 pods per node

- Cloud or On-premise?
  - Use Kubeadm/KOps/Kubespray for on-perm
  - GKE for GCP
  - EKS for AWS
  - AKS for Azure

- Workloads
  - How many?
  - What kind?
    - Web
    - AI
    - Big Data Analytics

- Application Resource Requirement
  - CPU intensive
  - Memory intensive

- Storage
  - High performance - SSD backed storage
  - Multiple concurrent connections - Network-based storage
  - Persist shared volumes - for shared access across shared PODs

- Network Traffic
  - Continuous Heavy
  - Burst

## Commands

```bash
# Get all resource configuration files from all namespaces
kubectl get --all-namespace -o yaml > all-deploy-services.yaml
```
